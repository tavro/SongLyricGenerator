[INTRO]
I live off love
I feed off love
I breathe off love
I think of love
I drink of love
I sink in love
And in the middle of the night i need my love
I need to grieve and need to need and be in love
My love is gonna come to me
Tonight

[CHORUS]
I give my love and all my love to you, my love
I feast on love, a beast for love, release my love
You're scared and unprepared for love, don't care my love
Cause youre the only woman i've been dreaming of
I swear to god i'm loving you for that
I swear to god i'm making you my wife

[VERSE]
And if you ever leave me
I never will be sore
I will love you 'til you're lonely
Then i will love you some more just before
Ohh

[OUTRO]
Beauty beauty beauty, there's nobody near me
There never was
Beauty beauty beauty, there's nobody near me
There never was
