[CHORUS]
Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game

[VERSE]
Send out for whiskey, baby
Send out for gin
Me and room service, honey
Me and room service, babe
Me and room service
Well, we're living a life of sin

[VERSE]
When I ain't drinking, baby
You are on my mind
When I ain't sleeping, honey
When I ain't sleeping, Mama
When I ain't sleeping
Well, you know you find me cryin'

[CHORUS]
Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game

[VERSE]
Living is a gamble, baby
Loving's much the same
Wherever I have played
Wherever I throw those dice
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game

[VERSE]
Maybe when I'm older, baby
Someplace down the line
I'll wake up older
So much older, Mama
Wake up older
And I'll just stop all my tryin'

[CHORUS]
Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same
