[VERSE]
Feel the light as it pours into my bedroom window
I can't get off of the floor
Hold my chest like the grip at the end of a pistol
Howling like a dog at the door to let you in to my heart
Show me everything

[CHORUS]
Don't really know what to say but I love you
Don't really know what to say but I love you
Hope at the end of the day I can hold you
Don't really know what to say but I love you

[VERSE]
Heard the sound of your voice when you said that you missed me
Dripping from the ink of your pen
Left your heart in the note hoping that it would hit me
Howling like a dog at the door to let you in to my heart
Show you everything

[CHORUS]
Don't really know what to say but I love you
Don't really know what to say but I love you
Hope at the end of the day I can hold you
Don't really know what to say but I love you

[VERSE]
Lie with me when everything all goes wrong
And I will sing to you all of your favorite songs
Let the world slow down
As you hear the sound

[CHORUS]
Don't really know what to say but I love you
Don't really know what to say but I love you
Hope at the end of the day I can hold you
Don't really know what to say but I love you
