[VERSE]
Hung my head when I heard the sound
I drove straight back to the burial ground
I saw you there, singing out loud
Was the same old song you used to sing
When you made your bed right next to me
And I loved you then, I still do now
Was a gray-blue grave and a short red dress
I knew you well, it suits you best
Where have you been for the past five years?
Last I heard you took some time
You drove straight down the 405
And we both know why you left me here

[PRE-CHORUS]
But oh, how things have changed
Now I act my age
And you are older too
So why not see this through

[CHORUS]
Cause your fast asleep
And you choose to be
Got your head in the water cause you won't find another like me
And every morning when you call his name
Think about another
Just say, just say it

[VERSE]
And I had you come for a midnight drink
When you left your things by the kitchen sink
Your pocketbook, can't you stay?
And quit your job that you hate so much
We'll both get by, we'll both make love
And your here tonight anyway

[PRE-CHORUS]
But oh, how things have changed
Now I act my age
And you are older too
So why not see this through

[CHORUS]
Cause your fast asleep
And you choose to be
Got your head in the water cause you won't find another like me
And every morning when you call his name
Think about another...
Just say, just say it
Just say, just say it
