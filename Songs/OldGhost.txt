[Verse]
I'm just an old ghost, nice as can be
I'm just an old ghost, you can see right through me
They marked my grave with a wooden cross
And told my gal, 'sorry for the loss'
It all ended on a Saturday night
When the showdown caught fire
And I was inside
Well I ran as fast as I could
But it didn't do me any good

[Chorus]
I wish my baby was, dead like me
Safe and sound in the ground, baby
Dead like me
Safe and sound in the ground, baby
Dead like me
I wish my baby was, dead like me
Safe and sound in the ground, baby
Dead like me
Safe and sound in the ground, baby
Dead like me
Oh, dead like me

[Verse]
She hits the bottle every night
It's a sight to see
Sits alone in our home, trying to talk to me
But I never get through
Oh, I always try to
She said I'm so tired, I'm so weak
Wish I could stand on my own two feet
Oh, pray for me, Saint Paula, pray for me

[Chorus]
I wish my baby was, dead like me
Safe and sound in the ground, baby
Dead like me
Safe and sound in the ground, baby
Dead like me
I wish my baby was, dead like me
Safe and sound in the ground, baby
Dead like me
Safe and sound in the ground, baby
Dead like me
Oh, dead like me

[Conclusion]
Oh, dead like me
