[VERSE]
I have a tendency to laugh at all the wrong moments
Sometimes I forget the words to my own song
I'm not the silent type or an exit sign or a yellow brick road
You are the one thing that I know

[CHORUS]
It's in the wine we drink, dirty dishes in the kitchen sink
And the lights go out til the sun comes up; we are not alone
It's in the miles we drive, never having to say goodbye
To the things we tell each other without saying a word
You are the one thing that I know

[VERSE]
There's a beauty that we never know what the future holds
Beneath the surface we are the calm, we are the storm
I'm not sunset or a hurricane or a Vincent Van Gogh
You are the one thing that I know

[CHORUS]
It's in the wine we drink, dirty dishes in the kitchen sink
And the lights go out til the sun comes up; we are not alone
It's in the miles we drive, never having to say goodbye
To the things we tell each other without saying a word
You are the one thing that I know

[OUTRO]
It's in the wine we drink, dirty dishes in the kitchen sink
And the lights to out til the sun comes up; we are not alone
You are the one thing that I know
