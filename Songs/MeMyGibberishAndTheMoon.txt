[VERSE]
i crouch low and smoke with spiders
to keep raindrops off my head
i'm singing bout your ghost love
in reverie like you were dead

[VERSE]
cuz i miss you already
you're the hollow in my bed
i want to be your stallion

[VERSE]
no it's not the nightmares
from our armistice in the fall
it's just that i feel your distance
and i love you like no one before

[VERSE]
i stalk the streets alone now
just me my gibberish and the moon
for i speak a different language
if i cannot speak with you
