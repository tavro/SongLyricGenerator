[Verse]
Nighthawk diner man, blueberries and cinnamon
Cup of coffee, cream to fuel the fire
Cigarette in hand, reading some instruction manual
You could be what you desire

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm, everyday I'm
Getting further and further away
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm, everyday I'm
Getting further and further
Start to consider it
What you desired wasn't this

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, this ain't it
Not even a little bit
You're the umpire in somebody else's game
And you'd better quit
You'd better quit

[Verse]
Sweat-faced counter woman, dreaming of a love that's coming
Half-regretting having read the flyer
Watching silver soda can, underneath the ceiling fan
Half-consumed and left there to perspire

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm, everyday I'm
Getting further and further away
Everyday I'm
Oh no, this ain't it
Everyday I'm
Oh no, this ain't it
Everyday I'm
Getting further and further
And start to consider it
What you desired wasn't this

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, this ain't it
Not even little bit
You're the umpire in somebody else's game

[Outro]
And you better quit as soon as you can
And you better quit as soon as you can
And you better quit as soon as you can
And you better quit as soon as you can
You can
You can
