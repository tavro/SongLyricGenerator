[CHORUS]
When the winter rains
Come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me
And wonder if I'm fine?

[VERSE]
Will your restless heart
Come back to mine
On a journey thru the past
Will I still be in your eyes
And on your mind?

[VERSE]
Now I'm going back to my home town
On a journey thru the past
And I won't be back
Till February comes
I will stay with you
If you'll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time
On a journey thru the past

[CHORUS]
When the winter rains
Come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes
And on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes
And on your mind?
