[CHORUS]
May all the roads that you take now be smooth ones
And you will awake with a smile
May all your wanderings bring to you wisdoms
Which you can forget for a while
Should there be gold darling for you to find there
May you make of it the most

[VERSE]
It will not matter now too much if I'm there
You will be there, there, there for us both

[CHORUS]
May all your happiness these days be lasting
And you'll know what's real and what's not
May you now purify all of your passions
And be good to what you have got
When you are called darling down to the river
Don't you just run to get wet

[OUTRO]
Stretch your paws along her shores
And gaze, gaze, gaze into her depths
Stretch your paws along her shores
And gaze, gaze, gaze into her depths
