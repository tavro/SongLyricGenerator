[Verse]
I walk past the bleak halls of an architect's un-imagination
Returning to the venue where we held that very first conversation
To see you again, to be your friend, to hold you in my mind
And I arrived there early and as always you swanned in much later
As if nothing had ever changed, you nod at me and order your double and mixer
To see you again, to be your friend, to hold you in my mind

[Chorus]
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse]
And I've been told your new playmate's successful and he's handsome and he's charming
It's a damn good job he isn't here or I may have wound up harming your darling
To see you again, to be your friend, to hold you in my mind

[Chorus]
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
We're laughing and we're joking like we always, always used to
Too rudely interrupted by your half-wit of a boyfriend who tries to call you
To see you again, to be your friend, to hold you in his mind

[Chorus]
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
