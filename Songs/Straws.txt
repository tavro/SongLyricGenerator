[Verse]
I couldn’t take another straw, my back is breaking
From everything I've seen, all I’ve heard
Don’t wanna hear another whisper
I already know who’s taken the last of my well-earned reward

[Verse]
I’ve been takin' turns with my little shadow
Just to see where your errors lie
Little did I know that my own shadow
It was gonna steal you from right up under my eyes

[Chorus]
And I’m so caught up placin' the path of my feet
I’ve lost touch letting my mind follow what pleases me

[Verse]
Just another straw, now my back is broken
Your crime crushed way more than bone
Just another straw, these words I’ve spoken
They’re all lies, I know

[Chorus]
And I’m so caught up placin' the path of my feet
I’ve lost touch letting my mind follow what pleases me
