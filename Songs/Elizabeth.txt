Theres a distance in your eyes
That's why a smile is always such a surprise
When you call and you talk to me
I wonder which person you're gonna be
She said All your songs are sad songs
Why do you always have to see the worst of it?
Could you write me just one love song?
Put my name somewhere in the middle of it
It's not hard to rhyme Elizabeth
Just close your eyes boy and take your best guess
Cause the truth is hard, isn't it?
She said I'll be listening in my favorite white dress.

All these quiet afternoons
She said I wonder if I've given up my love too soon.
As her hair fell from her curls
I said, You're pretty uptight for a Mexican girl.
She said All your songs are sad songs
Why do you always have to make me feel like shit?
Could you write me just one love song?
And put my name somewhere in the middle of it
And if you called the song Elizabeth
All my friends will know that it's about me
Cause the truth is hard, isnt' it?
But don't take too long cause I know you'll come back to me.

[FILLER]
Wooo ooooh wooo oooohh

[VERSE]
I said All these songs are love songs
Just love at times can make you feel like shit
So you write a string of words down
It's better if there's some truth in it
It's true I love you Elizabeth
I love the way you move in that silly white dress
Cause the truth is hard to admit
I've never known love this is just my best guess.
