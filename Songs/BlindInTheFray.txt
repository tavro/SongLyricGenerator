[VERSE]
Dime store
Penny shore
Waiting for
So much more
Crying out
Calling code
Apologies
A boarding soul

[CHORUS]
She turned to me
Blind in the fray
Weight of this world
She will not be tamed

[VERSE]
Let us in
Nothing yet
A hospital
A empty bed
Wishing well
All I'm read
The Fairytale is all but dead

[CHORUS]
She turned to me
Blind in the fray
Weight of this world
She will not be tamed

[CHORUS]
She turned to me
Blind the fray
Weight of this world
She will not be tamed

[CHORUS]
She turned to me
Blind in the fray
Weight of this world
She will not be tamed
