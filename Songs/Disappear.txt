[VERSE]
Light highs
Heavy lows
This years, had its share of those
From the painted arched ceilings
To the barroom floors

[Chorus]
When you wanna disappear my love
Stick around for a while
Stick around for a while
When the seasons they begin to change
You've run a ragged mile

[VERSE]
Long days so I crave the nights
While the months quickly call goodbye
From the snowy Denver mountains
To my bedroom walls

[Chorus]
At last the fire's burning out
The weakest flame is dying down
Now its time for me to rest my eyes
And calm my mind

[Alt-chorus]
But when you wanna disappear my love
You stay up all night
When you wanna disappear my love
You catch the morning sunrise
When you wanna disappear my love
You drive just to drive
When you wanna disappear my love stick around for a while
