[VERSE]
Early in the year feeling, fade away
Something has clearly gone today
Don’t know what I can do
But I know, I know, I know

[PRE-CHORUS]
That it’s the worst way to put you in a song
And I knew it as the words came
All of this was wrong
Early in the year
But I know, I know, I know

[VERSE]
That you nearly heal
In the feeling that fades away
There’s something clearly gone today
Don’t know what you wanna heal
But I know, I know, I know

[PRE-CHORUS]
That it’s the worst way to put you in a song
And I knew that as the words came
All of this was wrong
Early in the year
But I know, I know, I know

[CHORUS]
Even when the love’s gone
And don’t I show it
Even when your love comes
Baby, don’t I know it

[CHORUS]
Even when the love’s gone
Baby, don’t I show it
Even when your love comes
Baby, don’t I know it

[CHORUS]
Even when the love’s gone
Baby, don’t I show it
Even when your love comes
Baby, don’t I know it

[VERSE]
Even when the love’s gone
Don’t I show it
And even when the light’s on
There’s something wrong and don’t I know it

[VERSE]
And you don’t have to tell me nothing
Cause you know that you’ve already shown it
And even when you’re good and strong
The feeling’s gone and don’t I know it

[VERSE]
Even when the love is gone
The night turns, she can try to show it
Oh, why, why, oh, why, why don’t I know it?
Oh, why, why, oh, why, why don’t I show it?

[OUTRO]
Don’t I know it?
Oh, why, why don’t I show it?
Don’t I show it?
