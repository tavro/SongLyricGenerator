[VERSE]
Little boy inside my chest
Beat my heart just like a drum
Tell him I'll never forget
How it was when we were young

[VERSE]
'Cause you and I, we dreamed a dream
On the road in '93
To tell him it's not over yet
I still got some fight in me

[Chorus]
Woah, I'm gonna lie low
Smoke in my hand, oh
Lying awake in my hotel bed, oh
Down in the valley, down in my love, oh
Darling I pray something picks me up

[BRIDGE]
I'll never let this go
I'll do this on my own

[VERSE]
Little boy inside my chest
Breathe some life into my bones
I've been lost and wandering
Down and out and missing home

[VERSE]
'Cause you and I we dreamed a dream
On the road with my guitar
So beat a little louder now
I can't hear you anymore

[Chorus]
Woah, I'm gonna lie low
Smoke in my hand, oh
Lying awake in my hotel bed, oh
Down in the valley, down in my love, oh
Darling I pray something picks me up, hey

[BRIDGE]
I'll never let this go
I'll do this on my own

[VERSE]
And we never got too tired
And we never got too old
We just ran through the streets forever, arm in arm
And the setting sun was higher than it ever was before
And we never knew perfection like it was

[VERSE]
Woah, I'm gonna lie low
Smoke in my hand, oh
Lying awake in my hotel bed, oh
Down in the valley, down in my love
Darling I pray that you'll hold

[BRIDGE]
I'll never let this go
I'll do this on my own
