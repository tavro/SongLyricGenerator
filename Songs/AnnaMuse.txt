[INTRO]
Confess your love
Confess your whole heart too
Confess your dreams and
I will tell you my demons too

[VERSE]
We will compare our stories
Our trials and our glories
I hope mine's not boring you
Anna Muse

[VERSE]
I will tell you the things you’ve said before
All things you thought I’d ignore

[FILLER]
La da da da

[VERSE]
Your words become my truth
Oh, my water, my saving parachute

[VERSE]
Your breath is my wine
Your heart is my youth
I will pretend you’re mine but I am a fool
I am a fool, I am a foool 

[FILLER]
oh no

[VERSE]
So I will close my eyes and dream that you may lead me to your room
Love is my dream, yet love is my demon, am I still a man to you?
Anna Muse

[VERSE]
She hides her sleeve up in her heart
With all her salty memories stored up part-by-part
Young love is a blunder
Young love is a farse
Young love is self-serving and
Young love's forgot
Oh that love is no longer an art

[VERSE]
Her face has launched a thousand ships
With war-torn heart for just a kiss
But soon some man will take the flower
Oh, soon some man will take the flower
Of Anna!

[VERSE]
I lost what I had never had
What I created in my heart
And in my bed

[VERSE]
She showed me that my words are dead
And some things are better left unsaid

[OUTRO]
We compared our stories
Our trials and our glories
It turns out you’re boring too
Anna Muse
