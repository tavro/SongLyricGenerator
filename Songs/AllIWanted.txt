[VERSE]
If you say to me you'd let me be your man for just one night
I'd climb these walls, I'd climb to fall so softly in your sweet arms, baby

[CHORUS]
That's all I wanted, that's all I need
That's all I ever really wanted for you to be right next to me

[VERSE]
If this ship goes south, I won't look down
No, I'll look to my side
Cause if you're right there, I won't be scared
Just laughing on the way down, baby

[CHORUS]
That's all I wanted, that's all I need
That's all I ever really wanted for you to be right next to me

[VERSE]
I will come and take you home
If you need me baby, I'm there
I will come and take you home
Just let me know
