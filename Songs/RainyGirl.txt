[VERSE]
Rainy girl
I can't wait to meet you
And I can't wait to hear your name
And sing it to the skies above

[VERSE]
Rainy girl
Wash away my memory
Swimming through infinity, for you will be
My love

[CHORUS]
Sometimes when I'm falling in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
I guess we're going everywhere together
Rainy girl

[BRIDGE]
The sun is coming up for me
Black bird on a wire sings a song, so blue

[CHORUS]
Sometimes when I'm falling in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
Guess we're going everywhere together
Rainy girl

[BRIDGE]
Home at last
Following a cloud

[CHORUS]
Sometimes when I'm falling in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
I guess we're going everywhere together
Guess we're going everywhere together
Guess we're going everywhere together
Rainy girl
I can't wait to meet you
