[VERSE]
When the sun lights up your face
Don't give me time, don’t give me space
Just give me something that I can taste
Like you right by my side

[VERSE]
Oh all of my time these days
Just to put a smile on your face
Just to make those bad dreams fade
I give and I take

[VERSE]
Oh the worst of times
Never known the best of them
Only known the best of friends
And the means unto my end

[PRE-CHORUS]
I hear you saying baby please just try
I think about you every night
I think about everlasting life
And I watch those days go by

[CHORUS]
When the sun lights up your face
Don't give me god, don't give me grace
Just give me something that I can taste
Like you right by my side

[VERSE]
I am young in eternity
I am old in my father’s face
I don't really mean what I say
But if I did then would you stay?

[PRE-CHORUS]
Voices saying getting right with the lord
I hear he's swinging that holy sword
I hear he knew me before I was born
I've been bought and warned

[CHORUS]
When the sun lights up your face
Don't give me time, don't give me space
Just give me something that I can taste
Like you right by my side

[VERSE]
When I still think about you every night
All my means and all my tries
I think about everlasting life
And I watch those days go by
Yes now I watch those days go by
