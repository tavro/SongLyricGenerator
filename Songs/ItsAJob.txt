[Verse]
I can see that you are waiting for my time to come, but I am lost inside
If I can be that lost from the inside
How am I alive? You try to read my mind

[Chorus]
Everybody knows that it's a job
Everybody knows how much it costs

[Verse]
Shy and sweet
My moves are a never-ending smile
With time, desire is calcified
The life you need to lose is unspeakable
Denial, it's mine
His crimes are versatile

[Chorus]
Everybody knows that it's a job
Everybody knows how much it costs

[Bridge]
Raining in my sea
Hoping she don't follow me back home
Shaking as I speak
Hoping she don't follow me back home

[Verse]
I can see that you are waiting for my
Time to come, but I am lost inside
If I can be that lost from the inside
How am I alive? You try to read my mind

[Chorus]
Everybody knows that it's a job
Everybody knows how much it costs
Everybody knows that it's a job
Everybody knows how much it costs

[Bridge]
Raining in my sea
Hoping she don't follow me back home
Shaking as I speak
Hoping she don't follow me back home
