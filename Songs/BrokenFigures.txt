[VERSE]
Hopeless
He says that everything is hopeless
And now we're old enough to notice it
He says we're bound for sure destruction
But our eyes have been closed to it
Out of sight
Left a letter and left town tonight
He said it's better to lay down than fight
And as he went [?] she carried off every weapon in sight
And she tells him, "I'm like a lit stick of dynamite;
I could blow you right down."
And I've lost a lot trying to better your clock
But whatever you've lost, I've found

[CHORUS]
So don't stop me now;
I'm already past the point of trying to figure it out
And if what's coming out of your mouth
Is just a taste of all the trouble broken figures have found
Well then you can't say what you've got on your mind
Or wash your hands of everything and write off the time
She says they should call you Mr. Kind
Because you love ‘em before you leave ‘em behind

[VERSE]
When the bars close down, I know tomorrow you'll be harder to find

[VERSE]
And I'm aching now
I mean I'm waking up and breaking out
I'm throwing off the chains that weighed me down
And erase the final fate I've found
And I'm losing it by any definition you'd submit
I used to fumble when you move your lips, and stumble when you'd pull me down
And this love is getting awful rough, and we're both getting knocked around

[CHORUS]
So don't stop me now;
I'm already past the point of trying to figure it out
And if what's coming out of your mouth
Is just a taste of all the trouble broken figures have found
Then you can't say what you've got on your mind
Or wash your hands of everything and write off the time
She says they should call you Mr. Kind
Because you love ‘em before you leave ‘em behind

[VERSE]
And it takes a lot to get her out the love seat
And she's lost, but she says she's had enough of me
I'm blowing off ambitions that she tried to keep
She's having thoughts of spending time in other scenes
And like a boss, she's rolling up her rubber sleeves
Wash it off about as quickly as her lover bleeds
Knees crossed out to live to watch another leave
Reason tossed about through fifty thousand other means
So, with all broken figures that you tried to be
All statisticians that showed you what you had to see
All the songs that said we'd live in perfect harmony
If you'd just loved enough of me, just loved enough

[VERSE]
Yeah, and all broken figures that you tried to be
You said that you thought that I would wait for rains to come
All statisticians that showed you what you had to see
No... you're impressed that I was coming on strong
All the songs that said we'd live in perfect harmony
I tried to tell you I had said it all wrong,
If you'd just loved enough of me, just loved enough
but I guess you don't [?]
And it takes a lot to get her out the love seat
[?] when you're set on breaking down
And she's lost, but she says she's had enough of me
Yeah, you've shown that you're ready for it now.
I'm blowing off ambitions that she tried to keep
Hell, you always have to let it all out.
She's having thoughts of spending time in other scenes
So, let it out, just let it out!
