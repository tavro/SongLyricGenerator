[Verse]
Lay your love on mine
Lay your love on mine
Let your safety fall
Let your safety fall
Lay your pride on the line
Lay your pride on the line
No one's keeping score

[Pre-Chorus]
No one's keeping you away from me
Only fear and doubt can be the downfall
It's our enemy
Who are you trying to blame?
It's no one's fault
Cause inside of me
I love you to the core

[Chorus]
If you leap inside the corners of my mind
Somersault into my emotions
I'm a river till you take the dive
Ocean
Ocean

[Verse]
Keep your lips on mine
Keep your lips on mine
Steady to the shore
Steady to the shore
Crash into the lies
Crash into the lies
The truth will keep us warm

[Pre-Chorus]
The truth will keep you away from me
Only fear and doubt can be the downfall
It's our enemy
Who are you trying to blame?
It's no one's fault
Cause inside of me
I love you to the core

[Chorus]
If you leap inside the corners of my mind
Somersault into my emotions
I'm a river till you take the dive
Ocean
Ocean
Ocean
Ocean

[Chorus]
If you leap inside the corners of my mind
Somersault into my emotions
I'm a river till you take the dive
Ocean
Ocean
Ocean
