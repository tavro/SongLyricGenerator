[Verse]
You're so unattainable, you know
We'll float high and fall below as ghosts

[Chorus]
Dress me up in your chameleon skin
I don't wanna remember who I've been

[Verse]
And so time just seems to move slow
So go, go ahead, abuse control

[Chorus]
Dress me up in your chameleon skin
I don't wanna remember who I've been
Dress me up in your chameleon skin
I don't wanna remember who I've been
Who I've been

[Bridge]
Woo-woo, woo-woo

[Chorus]
Dress me up in your chameleon skin
I don't wanna remember who I've been
Dress me up in your chameleon skin
I don't wanna remember who I've been
Who I've been
Who I've been

[Outro Chorus]
Dress me up in your chameleon skin
I don't wanna remember who I've been
Dress me up in your chameleon skin
I don't wanna remember who I've been
