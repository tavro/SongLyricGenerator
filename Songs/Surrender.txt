[VERSE]
It’s sweeter than yesterday, it’s better than tomorrow
Moment by moment abiding in you
I can do most anything, as long as it’s You and me
I will claim my victory abiding in You

[CHORUS]
Lord, I surrender, I surrender to You
Lord, there is nothing I can do
Nothing without You, nothing without You

[VERSE]
I died with You on that cross
I rose with You, no longer lost
Lay my life down at Your feet
No longer mine, but Yours to keep

[CHORUS]
Lord, I surrender, I surrender to You
Lord, there is nothing I can do
Nothing without You, nothing without You

[VERSE]
You are radiant, glorious, the Father’s final say
By Your word you hold all things, in You I will remain
Like waking from a dream to a mystery of mysteries
Heaven in my heart enshrined, Jesus, You’re all I see

[CHORUS]
Lord, I surrender, I surrender to You
Lord, there is nothing I can do
Nothing without You, nothing without You
