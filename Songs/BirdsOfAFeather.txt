Come with me I found ya good weather

Wipe your tears away my dear
I'm so glad that you are near

[PRE-CHORUS]
Ooh, peaking at my cheek, conveniency
You don't even want me
Ooh yeah
You don't even want me

I keep trying to fly away but you keep putting stones on my wings
I keep trying to fly away but you keep putting stones on my wings

I scream your name, is this a game
Loving me when you want to feel sane
​

Let me go, get off your throne
You only call me when you are alone

Ooh, peaking at my cheek, conveniency
You don't even want me
Ooh yeah
You don't even want me

I keep trying to fly away but you keep putting stones on my wings

[PRE-CHORUS]
Ooh, peaking at my cheek, conveniency
You don't even want me
Ooh yeah
You don't even want me

I keep trying to fly away but you keep putting stones on my wings
I keep trying to fly away but you keep putting stones on my wings
I keep trying to fly away but you keep putting stones on my wings
