[VERSE]
Oh I came in on bending knee
It wasn’t hard to fall for me
You stood beneath the burning tree
And hoped to rescue leaves
I figured it’s the things I’ve done
Something bout the man that I’ve become
Hey look at all the hearts we’ve won
These restless little thieves

[VERSE]
I shiver through the words I’ve said
They’re warmer than the ones that never left my head
I’ve made an ocean of this bed
And now I bet you’d starve to roll through it

[CHORUS]
Well you can let your arrows sing
I’ve never met a man of iron skin but you know
Archers never make good kings
Fly head first into everything now ooh

[VERSE]
I settled into heart and soul
Sell the only thing that I could never own
We fell into these arms but now
We will risk our limbs to find out who we are
Well I can try to get you closer but
I know you’d break your neck just to see the stars
And if we don’t dare to hold it
Then this reckless wandering love was never ours

[CHORUS]
Archers never make good kings
Fly head first into everything now ooh
I came in on bending knee
